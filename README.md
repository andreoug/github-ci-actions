# Github CI Actions

If you are investigating the github's actions for CI workflows, you can fork this repo and then check on your profile and your forked repository the "build" action that will be available.

You can also check my **Actions** on this repository. It is a simple use of the default button "Simple workflow By GitHub" with some extra lines on the multi-line script for the availability of maven, java, docker, and docker-compose executables on the github's hosted runner **ubuntu-latest**, that I am currently using. 

As a matter of fact, you are free from github to use other [runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) for windows or mac instead of ubuntu, too.

As you already guessed this is the starting point for a java, maven, linux application stack. You can create your own repo for your own stack and check all the available options for actions by github. 

You can read more about github actions at [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) documentation.
